# Learning AngularJS

## Overview

* While I am a polyglot software developer, much of my time in the last fifteen years has been spent doing Java.
* AngularJS is interesting to me, and I'm starting to learn it.
* I find the "state of the art" with AngularJS (and other Javascript frameworks for single-page apps) much less mature...or maybe I haven't been looking in the right places?
* This is a place to capture questions, thoughts, and lessons learned

## Topics

* Tutorials/Learning
* Building
* Testing
    * Frameworks
